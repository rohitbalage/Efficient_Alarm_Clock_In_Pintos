# Pintos
Labs for graduate OS class (545) at Cleveland State University. 

Code is from Labs for undergraduate OS class (600.318) at Johns Hopkins. [Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) 
is a teaching operating system for x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small
but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run x86 machine and simulators 
including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). The main source code, documentation and assignments 
are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).
There are some minor changes made by ([Ryan Huang](huang@cs.jhu.edu))
